# PAPINI - Network Attached Storage

  This is a personal project where I transform a recycled Intel I5 into a NAS. 
  
 ## Installation
 
 1. Download Open Media Vault ISO and burn it using Rufus or similar, e.g. Etcher
 2. Install Open Media Vault. Recommended, install it on a flash drive.
 3. Wipe all drives that you are going to use for the NAS.
