# PAPINI - Network Attached Storage

  This is a personal project where I transform a recycled Intel I5 into a NAS. 
  
## Installation
 
 1. Download Open Media Vault ISO and burn it using Rufus or similar, e.g. Etcher
 2. Install Open Media Vault. Recommended, install it on a flash drive.
 3. Wipe all drives that you are going to use for the NAS.

## Flash drive optimizations for Debian:
  
  Run the following for better perfomance on I/O large files.
  
  ´echo noop > /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler´
